# Slider

### Create a slider to choose between various themes for your webpage. The webpage should include the following elements:

- The webpage should be divided into two sections. One section shows the description of theme and other section contains an image.
- The outermost div should have class named `slider-container`.
- Two sections should have class as `.right-slide` and `.left-slide`.
- The webpage should have two buttons with `class=up-button` and `class=down-button`.
- At a time only one theme should be visible to the user.
- If a user clicks on the up button he moves to the previous slide and uf he clicks down button he moves to next slide.
- If a user is at first slide and clicks on up button he moves to last slide and if a user is currently at last slide and clicks on the down button he moves to first slide.
- Each slide should have id as `slide-1`, `slide-2`, `slide-3`, `slide-4`.
- For each slide the left section has a heading h1 that represent the title and a p tag for showing description.
- Info for slide 1 : data in h1 : `Nature flower`, data in p : `all in pink`. 
- Info for slide 2 : data in h1 : `Bluuue Sky`, data in p : `with it's mountains`. 
- Info for slide 3 : data in h1 : `Lonely castle`, data in p : `in the wilderness`. 
- Info for slide 4 : data in h1 : `Flying eagle`, data in p : `in the sunset`.
